<div class="title">LaTeX style file for Oceanography theses</div>
<div class="author">Dan Kelley 2010-02-17</div>

<h1>Background</h1> 

<p> Dalhousie's Faculty of Graduate Studies (FGS) places some fairly stringent
demands on the formatting of theses, but they provide little in the
way of help in meeting these demands. Students who use GUI-based
document preparation systems will find the rules to be annoying, but
easy to obey. That is not the case for students writing more
mathematical or technical theses, who tend to use LaTeX. </p>

<p>To ease the burden, students and faculty at Dalhousie have
developed a set of LaTeX style sheets. These have been in continual
development for a couple of decades, so they have passed through many
hands. </p>

<p> The present version of <tt>ocethesis.cls</tt>
is based very closely on the Department of Computer Science 
<tt>dalcsthesis.cls</tt> style file, which is so well
described at <a
href="http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/">http://users.cs.dal.ca/~vlado/dalcsthesis/</a>
that any sensible reader of the present document will follow the
link. </p>

<h1>Instructions for using the style sheet</h1>

<p>First,
download <a href="http://github.com/dankelley/dal-oce-thesis/zipball/master">dal-oce-thesis.zip</a>
and unzip it. Enter the directory that is thus created. There, you
will see an example thesis file <tt>mythesis.tex</tt> (which uses
separate files for chapter 1, etc.). You should be able to run LaTeX
on this file. If not, there is a problem that you will have to solve
before proceeding any further. Once latex runs, you should run bibtex,
to link the citations. Then run latex two more times, to resolve the
cross-links. The result should be a nicely formatted thesis, but one
with some pretty odd content. The title will be
<i>(Insert title here)</i>, and so on. This is placeholder text,
chosen so that you can easily locate it in the <tt>mythesis.tex</tt>
file.</span>

<p>The second step is to start modifying the placeholder text
in <tt>mythesis.tex</tt> (or, better, a copy of this file), and to
start changing the placeholder text. Also, start adding your
references to the bibliography
file, <tt>literature.bib</tt>.</p>

<p>Note that this sample file uses a figure, in the
file <tt>figure1.pdf</tt>. You will need to find out how to work with
whatever type of figures your software creates. Do that and test it
with this sample file, before going much further, since you will be
able to save a lot of time by deciding on figure format from the
start.  It is a good idea chat with another student who uses similar
software to make figures.</p>

<p>In ten minutes, you should be well on your way. Many students find
it helpful to put chapter content in separate files, as in the
example, so that you can comment out chapters you are not actively
working on. There are loads of other tricks, too -- consult with other
latex users. The good thing is that you <i>should</i> not have to
worry about formatting.</p>

<h1>Known errors in this version</h1>

<ul>

<li> Something is wrong with appendices. Cross-referencing seems not
to work, and the appendices are not automatically entered into the
table of contents. See the example file <tt>mythesis.tex</tt> for a
workaround for the table of contents. Unfortunately, there is not yet
a solution for cross-referencing; you will have to write e.g. <tt>(see
appendix A)</tt> instead of <tt>(see
appendix~\ref{appendix-name})</tt>

</ul>

<h1>Changes from previous versions</h1>

<ul>

<li>Version 0.9 (released 2010-02-17) is as 0.8 except that the
\texttt{\appendix} line is moved from the appendix file to the main
file.  (Thanks to Eric O., for this.)

<li>Version 0.8 (released 2010-01-04) is as 0.7 except for two changes
that should decrease the likelihood of excessive whitespace.  The
first change, in the <tt>ocethesis.cls</tt> file, is to alter the
spacing before and after all section headings is adjusted, to decrease
the incidence of excessive whitespace that can occur near unbreakable
items.  The second, in the <tt>mythesis.tex</tt> document, is to use
the <tt>\raggedbottom</tt> command, to move excessive space to the
page bottom.

<li>Version 0.7 (released 2009-03-30) is as 0.6 except that M.Sc. and
Ph.D. are now abbreviated MSc and PhD, and the flexibility of spacing
before and after section headings is adjusted to reduce the chance of
ugly whitespace in other parts of the document.

<li>Version 0.6 (released 2008-09-02) is as 0.5 except that the
Dedication and List of Symbols show up.

<li>Version 0.5 (released 2008-07-16) is as 0.4 except that
the <tt>\examiner{}</tt> works for MSc.

<li>Version 0.4 (released 2008-02-18) is as 0.3 except that
the <tt>appendix</tt> package is used to get correct
cross-referencing.  Note that it seems that this must be high up in
the inclusion list, so it is put at the top in the example file.

<li>Version 0.3 is as 0.2 except that the margin spacing is more
correct.

<li>Version 0.2 is as 0.1 except that the chapter and section headings
are modified.

<li>Version 0.1 is as 
<tt>dalcsthesis.cls</tt> except that (a) the page height is adjusted
to make the margin below the page number be 1/2 inch, (b) upper/lower
case is used in titles, (c) line breaks are changed in some
boilerplate text (e.g. "Submitted in partial fulfillment")

</ul>

<h1>Rules on the writing</h1>

<p>You should consult with the Faculty of Graduate Studies on rules
regarding the writing.  Having said that, here are a few hints:</p>

<ul>

<li>The first sentence of each figure captions are to be used in the
list of figures.  In LaTeX, the material for the list of figures is
given in square brackets, prior to the curly-bracketed caption.  You
can save yourself a lot of time by getting this right at the start.
Note that the sentences that appear in the list of figures should be
short and simple.  (Some writers use non-sentences, e.g. they might
write as follows.
<pre>\caption[Sampling array.]{Sampling array.  Top panel: plan
view of sampling array, with instrument types as listed in the legend.
Bottom panel: diagram of an individual instrument.}</pre>
</p>
</ul>
